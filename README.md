- 👋 Hi, I’m Joerg Vollrath
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics and embedded sytems using JavaScript and HTML. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with github and do collaborative coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EEBench a Hardware Software platform to realize an electronic oscilloscope, waveform generator, power supply and digital IO.
- A browser based user interface realized with nodejs should control an FPGA (BASYS2), Arduino or RaspberryPi with ADC, DAC, IOs and powersupplies.
